Creating your first Laravel project involves several steps. Here's a basic guide to get you started:

### Prerequisites:
Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
1. **PHP**: Laravel requires PHP 7.x or higher.
2. **Composer**: Dependency manager for PHP, used for Laravel installation.
3. **A web server**: Apache or Nginx.
4. **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or SQL Server.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. Install Laravel Installer (if not already installed):
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

#### 2. Create a New Laravel Project:
Navigate to your desired directory where you want to create the project, and run:
```bash
laravel new project-name
```
Replace `project-name` with the name you want for your Laravel project.

#### 3. Set Up Configuration:
Once the installation completes, navigate into your project directory:
```bash
cd project-name
```

#### 4. Configure Environment:
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` to set up your database credentials and other configurations like `APP_NAME`, `APP_URL`, etc.

#### 5. Generate Application Key:
Run the following command to generate a unique application key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

#### 6. Serve the Application:
You can use Artisan's `serve` command to quickly start a local development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### 7. Verify Installation:
Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the Laravel welcome page indicating that your installation was successful.

### Additional Steps (Optional):

- **Database Migration**: Laravel's migration feature allows you to manage database schema changes. You can create migrations for your tables and run them using Artisan commands.
  
- **Create Routes and Views**: Define your application routes in `routes/web.php` and create corresponding views in `resources/views`.

- **Explore Laravel Documentation**: Laravel has comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of development. Refer to it for more advanced features and customization options.

By following these steps, you should have a basic Laravel project set up and ready for development.
